# Fatima zahra iguenfer

**`Patime (CS student/Research enthusiast/Blogger)`**

I am a senior Computer Science student at Al Akhawayn University with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in Mathematics. I am deeply enthusiastic about conducting research that combines these fields, and particularly fascinated by Natural Language Processing. A fun fact about me is when I'm not studying/working, you can find me sipping on iced coffee, binge-watching a TV series, or writing a blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@fz.iguenfer).
