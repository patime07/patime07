I am a senior Computer Science student at Al Akhawayn University with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in Mathematics. I have a deep enthusiastic about research that combines these
fields, and particularly fascinated by Natural Language Processing. A fun fact about me is when I'm not studying/working, you can find me sipping on iced coffee, binge-watching a TV series, or writing a blog on Medium [https://medium.com/@fz.iguenfer].
